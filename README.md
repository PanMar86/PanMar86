## About me 👋

![quantum_physics](quantum_physics.jpg)

My name is Panagiotis Marentakis and I am a certified medical physicist (MPE | RPE) based in Greece.

I am mostly interested in radiation oncology, medical image processing and machine/deep learning. I use programming as a practical tool to automate and improve clinical workflows, while expressing my creative side. I love taking abstract and vague concepts and turn them into compact software solutions that improve the quality of the healthcare services.

Recently I developed a lightweight, Python based toolkit that aims to automate the evaluation process of a radiotherapy treatment plan, taking into account both the target coverage and the protection of the critical structures (OARs).

As a person in general, I am a strong believer in continuous learning and I constantly seek new challenges and opportunities.
